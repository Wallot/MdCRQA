# MdCRQA
This repository contains R and Matlab functions for the computation of Multidimensional Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (MdCRQA) from the paper "Multidimensional Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (MdCRQA) – a method for quantifying correlation between multivariate time-series."

## Repository Content
The mdcrqa.m and mdcrqa.R-functions compute multidimentional cross-recurrence plots and the associated cross-recurrence measures. The dcrp.m and dcrp.R-functions compute diagonal cross-recurrence profiles based on the cross-recurrence plots obtained from the mdcrqa-functions.
The lorenzData.csv and roesslerDater.csv-files contain the data from the two dynamical systems used in the manuscript to illustrate the analysis.
